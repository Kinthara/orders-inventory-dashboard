# 🧾 Orders & Inventory – Angular UI

This is the **frontend UI** of the Orders & Inventory Dashboard — a demo fullstack application designed to simulate a simple order and stock management system.

Built with **Angular 18** and **Angular Material**, this SPA connects to a backend (developed separately in Java/Spring Boot) and integrates modern observability tools like **OpenTelemetry** and **Grafana**.
